Statistical analysis of audio characteristics is widely spread now. Many people use it for various purposes: from sorting songs by genre(based on some audio features) to analyzing reasons of popularity of songs. On the other hand, it has not been studied well how music popularity can be defined, what are its characteristics, and whether it can be 'qualitatively' predicted. Since in these days, a large amount of multimedia content is delivered to users through various media and platforms, popularity prediction has become more practical. Our work is a good contribution to this problem.
